A declaration binds a *non-blank identifier* to a **constant**, **type**, **type parameter**, **variable function**, **label** or **package**. <br/>

The blank identifier and init function do not introduce new bindings. 

**Scope** of an identifier is the region of the code where that identifier can be used to refer to the same entity (variable, function, struct, etc.) that it was declared to represent.
